# Enumerable Drills Lab

## Introduction
In this lab, we will practice working with enumerables to access data within a collection. 


## Learning Goals
Use the following enumerators to iterate through collections. Use the tests to guide you. Focus on writing clean methods and making sure all three parts of your code is correct.
 
* map
* select
* find
* each
* sort
* max
* include?
* all?
* any?


## Conclusion

As you can see, you can manipulate data in more ways than you can possibly imagine. Keep reading through the documentation, and don't be afraid to play around with IRB and break things! You'll be surprised at what you can discover when you think you've broken everything - that's when the best breakthroughs happen.
